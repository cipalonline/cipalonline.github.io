<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned Linux user or a newcomer, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. We&rsquo;ll walk you through the process, explain the concepts, and provide tips and tricks to make your experience smooth and enjoyable.</p>
<p><em><strong>Important</strong>: This guide is based on the assumption that the required packages have been installed using the <code>scripts/initpkg.sh</code> script. Please ensure that you have successfully run this script before proceeding with the steps outlined in this guide.</em></p>
<h2 id="initializing-the-desktop-environment">Initializing the Desktop Environment</h2>
<p>The first step in setting up BSPWM on Arch Linux is to initialize the LightDM display manager. This can be done by enabling it through the system control as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl enable lightdm
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to create custom directories for BSPWM and SXHKD  in the <code>.config</code> directory. This can be done using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p .config/{bspwm,sxhkd}
</code></pre>
<p>Once the directories are created, we can proceed to install the necessary files with the appropriate permissions. We&rsquo;ll use the <code>install</code> command to copy the example configuration files from the BSPWM and SXHKD documentation to our newly created directories:</p>
<pre><code>$ install -Dm755 /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc .config/bspwm/
$ install -Dm644 /usr/share/doc/sxhkd/examples/sxhkdrc .config/sxhkd/
</code></pre>
<p>After installing the files, it&rsquo;s crucial to modify the <code>sxhkdrc</code> file located in the <code>.config/sxhkd/</code> directory. This file contains the configuration for the hotkeys, including the one for opening the terminal. If this is not set up correctly, you may encounter issues when trying to open a terminal after a system restart. Therefore, ensure that the terminal program is correctly set in the <code>sxhkdrc</code> file.</p>
<p>Remember, each step is crucial for the successful installation and operation of the BSPWM on Arch Linux. Happy coding!</p>
