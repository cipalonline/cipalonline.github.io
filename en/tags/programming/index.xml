      <description>What is an Algorithm and how does it differ from a Program? An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions that define how a task should be performed. In programming, algorithms are fundamental as they define the logic that computers must follow to solve specific problems.&#xA;A program is the implementation of one or more algorithms in a specific programming language. While an algorithm can be represented in many ways, a program is a concrete artifact that can be executed by a computer.</description>
